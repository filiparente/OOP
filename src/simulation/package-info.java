/**
 * The package simulation contains the inteface for the simulation ISimulation where the run method is left for implementation.
 * The Simulation class is an abstract class where the method run is still abstract but the final instant of the simulation is a field.
 * The Hamiltonian class is a subclass of the Simulation class where the data structures required to run the program are associated (such
 * as the graph, pec and colony) and the run method is implemented.
